# Portal implementation audit — September 2026

This is a focused comparison of Runic's implemented portal paths with ashpd and
Tmds.DBus, not certification of every desktop or a proposal to expose every portal.

## Generation decision

Use Tmds.DBus.Generator with our existing Tmds.DBus.Protocol runtime, both pinned
to 0.95.1. The first pilot generates Registry and Notification proxies from
upstream 1.22.1 XML. The old reflection-oriented Tmds.DBus library and its legacy
codegen path are not needed. See the provider's `Protocol/README.md` for provenance
and reproduction commands.

Ashpd's update script synchronizes XML; its client also uses handwritten semantic
types and shared request infrastructure. XML only specifies many options as
`a{sv}`. It cannot replace platform policy, version-aware options or lifetime rules.

## Findings

| Area                                | Runic finding                                                                                                                                                                         | Action                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Host identity                       | Owning a bus name did not associate the notification connection with a desktop ID.                                                                                                    | Fixed before this pilot; generated Registry proxy preserves registration before portal calls.                                                         |
| Notification serialization          | Envelope, property and signal readers were handwritten.                                                                                                                               | Replaced with generated proxies; semantic option dictionaries remain explicit.                                                                        |
| Early notification actions          | Callback can precede AddNotification's reply.                                                                                                                                         | Preserve tracking before invoking the generated method; regression test covers this ordering.                                                         |
| Request/Response race               | File operations subscribe before submitting, correlate returned handles and support older handle paths.                                                                               | Keep existing implementation/tests during this pilot.                                                                                                 |
| Cancellation                        | File requests close their request handle; notification submissions drain a bounded reply once sent.                                                                                   | Preserve these distinct contracts; do not blindly forward cancellation into generated calls.                                                          |
| File descriptors                    | Tmds owns the wrapper; Runic retains the caller's SafeHandle through a borrowed wrapper.                                                                                              | Keep explicit ownership and existing FD conformance tests.                                                                                            |
| Versions                            | OpenFile needs v2; chooser/reveal features need v3. Notification public features use v1.                                                                                              | Preserve guards; generating newer members does not enable them automatically.                                                                         |
| Window parenting                    | GTK3/GTK4 adapters export owned X11/Wayland parents; owner changes invalidate requests.                                                                                               | Keep native owner adapters outside generated protocol code.                                                                                           |
| Notification portal restart         | The session bus can outlive the portal process.                                                                                                                                       | Implemented owner-bound calls and re-registration on the next notification operation; an in-flight replacement test proves no automatic replay.       |
| Host identity outside notifications | Services need consistent identity without sharing unrelated resource lifetimes.                                                                                                       | `PortalApplication` configures one ID for settings, notifications, chooser, URI and FD handoffs; each owned connection registers before portal calls. |
| Settings observation                | Runic polls and deduplicates; ashpd offers native SettingChanged streams.                                                                                                             | Consider signal observation with reconnect/resync if polling becomes measurable friction.                                                             |
| Activation focus                    | Notification ActivateAction preserves bounded activation-token and desktop-startup-id context. GTK3/GTK4 owners apply it before presenting the selected window on its dispatcher.     | KDE and GNOME live and cold GTK4 focus passed; focus remains compositor-controlled.                                                                   |
| Live coverage                       | JIT and NativeAOT protocol checks pass. KDE/GNOME Wayland notification actions and P1 file handoffs passed in reproducible guests; GTK4 live/cold focus also passed on both desktops. | macOS native providers remain implemented but untested pending Mac access.                                                                            |

## Interactive checks

Reuse the existing native prototype fixture instead of creating a second product
application. `--native-services` supports isolated Notifications, Open,
ChooseApplication and Reveal via `RUNIC_TEST_SERVICE`; notifications include
opt-in diagnostics and require the actual Open result callback. Supply an
installed desktop identity using `RUNIC_TEST_APP_ID`. The 120-second notification
wait withdraws the item when it ends, so check history before cleanup. The
portal-only test executable also supports `--settings` without a GTK host.

When extending this fixture, keep popup visibility, history retention, action
receipt, replacement, withdrawal and cold relaunch separate observations. A
successful AddNotification reply proves request acceptance only.
