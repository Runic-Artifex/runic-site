# ReactiveUI 26 support

Runic supports **ReactiveUI 26.0.1**, Binding **9.1.0**, Primitives **9.0.0**,
and SourceGenerators **4.2.0**. The default integration uses
`ReactiveUI.Primitives`; applications using the System.Reactive distribution select
`Runic.Application.Views.ReactiveUI.Reactive`. Select one flavor for an application,
then rebuild the application and its generated clients together when moving
between ReactiveUI majors. ReactiveUI 26 keeps the ReactiveUI 25 public API; the
[adapter migration notes](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/packages/dotnet/Runic.Application.Views.ReactiveUI/README.md#reactiveui-26)
cover the Primitives 9 `SubscribeSafe` change and the namespace changes from
ReactiveUI 24. If an interface-typed generic command leaves the
flavor ambiguous, set `RunicApplicationFrontendReactiveUiFlavor=reactive` in the generating
project for the System.Reactive flavor.

ReactiveUI remains the .NET ViewModel API. Runic generates a typed bridge for
selected public state, commands, interactions, and known view content. It does
not turn arbitrary observables, methods, CLR object graphs, or ReactiveUI APIs
into browser APIs.

## Supported contract surface

| ReactiveUI feature                                               | Generated bridge behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ReactiveObject`, `[Reactive]`, OAPH / `ToProperty`              | Public model state is observed through `INotifyPropertyChanged`. The generated property is exported after ReactiveUI's source generator has run; observables themselves are not serialized.                                                                                  |
| `WhenAnyValue`, operators, validation                            | Use them normally in .NET. Export their resulting supported state. `INotifyDataErrorInfo` property errors are published; ReactiveUI.Validation alone is not an exported validation contract.                                                                                 |
| `IReactiveCommand<TInput, TResult>`                              | Discovers interface, base, concrete, and combined command shapes independently of the command factory. Generated input/result codecs determine whether its values are bridgeable.                                                                                            |
| Plain `ICommand`                                                 | Add `[RunicCommandInput(typeof(TInput))]` to generate a typed argument. It remains synchronous fire-and-snapshot work: no retained result, operation handle, or invented cancellation contract.                                                                              |
| `CanExecute` and `IsExecuting`                                   | No-input commands publish `canX`; typed ReactiveUI commands also publish `isXExecuting`. Parameterized availability is checked from the decoded input at admission and execution time.                                                                                       |
| `Interaction<TInput, TOutput>` / `IInteraction<TInput, TOutput>` | A getter-only interaction property becomes a typed browser handler surface. Requests use a selected mounted endpoint and preserve normal ReactiveUI .NET-handler/unhandled fallback when no browser handler is eligible.                                                     |
| `IViewFor<T>`, locating views                                    | `ReactiveRunicView<T>` implements `IViewFor<T>`; Windows are `RunicWindow<T>` with every MVVM library. `ReactiveRunicViewLocator` adapts explicit ReactiveUI mappings and contracts.                                                                                         |
| `RoutingState`                                                   | `ReactiveRoutedRegion<T>` projects `CurrentViewModel` to observable generated content. Navigation remains .NET code; Runic does not generate URL history or an Avalonia routed host.                                                                                         |
| `WhenActivated`                                                  | Every mounted Runic presentation holds an activation lease. A shared ViewModel remains active until its final presentation unmounts.                                                                                                                                         |
| `Bind`, `BindTo`, `BindCommand`, converters                      | These are still useful for .NET views. They do not bind DOM elements or frontend components; use the generated TypeScript client for that.                                                                                                                                   |
| Schedulers                                                       | `IRunicModelContext` owns short serialized model turns. `AddRunicReactiveModelContext()` installs a model-context main-thread scheduler, so commands need no scheduler argument, and supplies a context-backed `ISequencer` (an `IScheduler` in the System.Reactive flavor). |

## Data contracts

The compiled-model generator builds one closed type graph for state, checked
writes, command input/results, and interaction input/results. It emits direct
C# codecs plus TypeScript types and decoders, so normal bridge serialization
does not need reflection metadata and remains suitable for trimming and Native
AOT.

Supported values include strings, booleans; signed/unsigned 8-, 16-, 32-, and
64-bit integers; `BigInteger`; finite `float`/`double`; `decimal`; enums;
`Guid`; `DateOnly`; `TimeOnly`; `DateTime`; `DateTimeOffset`; `TimeSpan`;
nullable values; public DTO records/classes; arrays; standard read-only/list
interfaces; `ImmutableArray`, `ImmutableList`, `ObservableCollection`, and
`ReadOnlyObservableCollection`; and string-keyed dictionaries.

The wire format is intentionally exact:

| CLR value                        | TypeScript value and wire form                                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 64-bit integers and `BigInteger` | `bigint`, encoded as an invariant decimal JSON string                                                    |
| `decimal`                        | string, encoded as an invariant exact decimal string                                                     |
| finite floats                    | `number`; NaN and infinities are rejected                                                                |
| enum                             | declared stable name string                                                                              |
| GUID and date/time values        | validated round-trip string; `DateTime` preserves its CLR kind and `DateTimeOffset` is normalized to UTC |
| `TimeSpan`                       | invariant `c` duration string                                                                            |
| observable collection            | snapshot array; collection changes and supported nested DTO/item notifications publish a new snapshot    |

DTO members include inherited application members and stop before framework
base classes. A public constructor must be usable to reconstruct a decoded DTO.
`[RunicIgnore]` excludes a member, `[RunicInclude]` makes an intentional
inclusion explicit, and `[RunicAlias("wireName")]` provides a stable wire name.
Aliases may contain characters such as hyphens. Generated TypeScript quotes the
declaration and uses bracket access, for example `state["exact-id"]`.
Hidden-member and wire-name collisions are diagnostics.

Use `[RunicUnion(typeof(CaseA), typeof(CaseB))]` on an interface or base class
for a closed polymorphic boundary. Each case may use
`[RunicUnionCase("case-name")]`; the wire value has a `$case` discriminator.
Flags enums require an explicit codec. Unsupported values, cycles, open-ended
polymorphism, non-string dictionary keys, and arbitrary `object` graphs are
rejected with a member path rather than falling back to reflection JSON.

For a type outside the built-in graph, implement static
`IRunicBridgeCodec<T>.Read` and `.Write`, then pair
`[RunicBridgeCodec(typeof(MyCodec))]` with a `[RunicCodecShape]` on the codec.
The shape gives the generated TypeScript type, validating decoder expression,
and optional encoder expression (identity is the default); a .NET-only JSON
converter cannot describe a safe frontend contract.

`ObservableCollection` and `ReadOnlyObservableCollection` report item changes
and refresh their generated snapshot. Plain `List<T>` and
`Dictionary<string, TValue>` are supported data shapes, but they have no
in-place mutation event. Raise `PropertyChanged` for their owning property or
replace the collection/dictionary after a mutation so the bridge can publish
the next snapshot.

## Typed command operations

Existing ordinary command calls preserve their fire-and-snapshot behavior.
Every discovered ReactiveUI command additionally has an idempotent operation
API. Its input is decoded before the command is admitted, and the same request
ID plus canonical input recovers the original work. Reusing an ID for a
different command or input is rejected.

`RxVoid`/`Unit` commands have no result and complete successfully even when
their observable yields zero values. A non-void command defaults to an
exactly-one result. Mark a property when its observable intentionally has a
different cardinality:

```csharp docs-test=skip:illustrative-fragment
[RunicCommandResult(BridgeCommandResultCardinality.Last)]
public IReactiveCommand<SaveRequest, SaveResult> SaveCommand { get; }

[RunicCommandResult(BridgeCommandResultCardinality.Stream)]
public IReactiveCommand<Query, Row> SearchCommand { get; }
```

The generated client exposes `startSave(input)`,
`startSaveWithRequestId(requestId, input)`, and
`recoverSaveWithRequestId(requestId)`. Each returns an operation with
`status()`, `completion`, `wait()`, and `cancel()`. A stream operation also
has `stream(cursor?)`, returning ordered `{ sequence, value }` items and the
next cursor. `completion` starts its terminal wait only when it is read, and
`wait()` starts the same cached wait. Results, operation count, individual
stream replay, and aggregate window retention are bounded. A delivery error
such as `result-too-large`, `result-encoding-failed`, `stream-overflow`, or
`stream-retention-too-large` is
visible in the status; it does not make a completed effect safe to retry.
`BridgeOperationUncertainError` means admission/status could not be observed,
so recover that request ID instead of automatically starting the action again.

The generated handle supplies its command member on status, wait, cancellation,
and stream reads. Reusing a request ID cannot let a handle for one command read
or cancel another command's operation, even where the command shapes match.

Runic cancels the subscription for an individual command execution. Task work
must honor its cancellation token. Continue observing `ThrownExceptions` in
the application: the bridge's rejected/failed reply does not replace
ReactiveUI's command error policy.

Use a plain synchronous command where its fire-and-snapshot contract is the
right fit:

```csharp docs-test=skip:illustrative-fragment
[RunicCommandInput(typeof(SaveRequest))]
public ICommand SaveCommand { get; }
```

## Browser interactions

An interaction property is application-owned and must be a public getter with
no public setter. Its browser surface is typed from the same graph:

```ts docs-test=skip:illustrative-fragment
const stop = view.interactions.confirmDiscard.handle(
  async (request, { signal }) => showConfirmation(request, signal),
);

// Call on component unmount when `view.dispose()` is not already its owner.
stop();
```

`handle` accepts a synchronous or asynchronous output and returns a disposer.
Replacing a handler, disposing it, or disposing the view aborts its
`AbortSignal`. Requests are delivered by an authenticated pull route to one
already-mounted handler; Runic never broadcasts interaction input in state.
The selected endpoint unmounting, disconnecting, timing out, or cancellation
ends that request. A user answer such as `false` is a normal output and differs
from cancellation or handler failure.

The adapter registers one handler for each Interaction object even if several
views or windows show the same model. It selects the browser only inside the
trusted bridge command/operation scope. Background .NET work has no implicit
"last mounted window" target: use a normal .NET handler or explicitly enter a
`RunicInteractionInvocation` scope with the intended session and route.

If a browser mounts multiple presentations of the same route, designate one
presentation to register each interaction handler. Multiple eligible handlers
on that connection make the destination ambiguous and preserve the normal
.NET fallback. The Reactive Notes Svelte and Angular demos keep a mirrored
editor mounted while the main editor owns confirmation.

Browser handler capabilities are registered independently of the request pull,
so an active handler remains eligible across a short polling gap. Each mounted
presentation has a bounded pending queue. A request that is no longer eligible
for that presentation is cancelled on delivery; it is not moved to another
window.

## Execution contexts

The model context types are in `Runic.Navigation`; add
`using Runic.Navigation;` when upgrading from a preview before preview.4.
The navigation and scheduler helpers are in `Runic.Navigation.ReactiveUI`, or
`Runic.Navigation.ReactiveUI.Reactive` for the System.Reactive flavor. They can
be installed independently for native MVVM; the corresponding Application
adapters reference them transitively. See the
[preview.4 migration tables](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/eng/release/notes/0.7.0-preview.4.md).

`RunicModelContext` queues short synchronous reads and mutations. Await I/O or
an interaction outside a turn, then use a later turn to commit state:

```csharp docs-test=skip:illustrative-fragment
await context.InvokeAsync(() => viewModel.IsSaving = true, cancellationToken);
var result = await repository.SaveAsync(request, cancellationToken);
await context.InvokeAsync(() => viewModel.Apply(result), cancellationToken);
```

`WindowContentSession` acquires a default context for its root model. The
CS-WebUI and Desktop hosts instead bind the root to the window scope's
`IRunicModelContext` when one is registered, so the context injected into the
ViewModel and the one used by its bridges are the same; a root already bound to a
different context fails window creation. Compose an app-shared graph
deliberately with `RunicModelContextRegistry.Shared.Bind` or `.Acquire`; bind
its root and independently presented children together. A second, different
context for the same object is rejected. Mounts lease views, not context
ownership. A custom `IRunicModelContext` must report `IsExecuting` for code
inside its turns: synchronous bridge routes run nested work inline in that case
and otherwise block until `InvokeAsync` completes. Snapshot delivery is ordered after its model turn so a
synchronous host callback cannot run while the model gate is held.

The default adapter's `RunicReactiveSchedulerProvider.For(context)` produces
an `ISequencer`; the System.Reactive flavor provides the analogous
`IScheduler`. They are delivery tools, not a replacement for the async command
body, host UI dispatcher, browser event loop, or application-wide ReactiveUI
main-thread scheduler.

Create and bind the context before constructing commands, then pass its
scheduler as the positional scheduler argument to the ReactiveUI factory:

```csharp docs-test=skip:illustrative-fragment
using Runic.Navigation;
using Runic.Navigation.ReactiveUI;

services.AddRunicReactiveModelContext();

public EditorViewModel(
    EditorSession session,
    IRunicModelContext modelContext,
    ISequencer scheduler)
{
    _scheduler = scheduler;
    Workspace = new EditorWorkspaceViewModel(session, this, _scheduler);
    _contextLease = RunicModelContextRegistry.Shared.Bind(modelContext, this, Workspace);
}

protected ReactiveCommand<string, RxVoid> CreateCommand(Func<string, Task> work) =>
    ReactiveCommand.CreateFromTask<string>(work, _scheduler);
```

Bind every independently presented child, including dynamically routed document
models, to that same context; keep each lease for as long as it is presented.
`AddRunicReactiveModelContext()` uses `TryAdd` to register one scoped default
context, one singleton scheduler provider, and a transient scheduler registration.
The provider returns one scheduler per context for that context's lifetime, so
repeated resolutions return the same instance, including for a singleton context.
An application's custom registrations remain in control; a singleton ViewModel
must not resolve a scoped context through that scheduler. Dispose the DI scope
asynchronously to drain a default context it owns.

Command `Execute` completion is separate from scheduled `IsExecuting` and
`CanExecute` notifications. The context scheduler serializes those
bridge-visible notifications with model turns, so state publication and bridge
replies retain their ordering. A default headless scheduler can notify later;
that is a normal scheduling choice, not a global scheduler setting to change.

The model context and both scheduler adapters capture `ExecutionContext` per
queued item. This preserves a trusted command/operation interaction scope for
its own deferred work without leaking that ambient state into another queued
turn; `ExecutionContext.SuppressFlow()` remains respected.

## Avalonia comparison

[ReactiveUI.Avalonia 12.1.6](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI.Avalonia/tree/v12.1.6/src/ReactiveUI.Avalonia)
also targets ReactiveUI 26. It supplies Avalonia controls, property binding,
visual-tree activation, routed hosts, and dispatcher integration. Runic's
equivalents are logical .NET presentations, acknowledged browser mounts,
explicit content maps, generated frontend contracts, and a host-neutral model
context. It intentionally does not add Avalonia as a dependency or copy its
control/template/converter APIs.

The implementation boundaries are the [type graph](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/tools/Runic.Application.Views.Codegen/BridgeTypeGraph.cs),
[operation emitter](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/tools/Runic.Application.Views.Codegen/OperationTypeScriptEmitter.cs),
[interaction emitter](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/tools/Runic.Application.Views.Codegen/InteractionCodeEmitter.cs),
[bridge runtime](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/packages/dotnet/Runic.Application.Views/BridgeRuntime.cs),
and [ReactiveUI adapter](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/v0.7.0-preview.6/packages/dotnet/Runic.Application.Views.ReactiveUI/ReactivePresentation.cs).

The ReactiveUI-specific Native AOT fixture exercises the direct generated
codecs and command bridge without warnings. It is focused contract coverage;
it does not claim full host, platform, or frontend-matrix coverage.

The default and System.Reactive flavors also run the same behavioral
conformance source. It covers command cardinality, cancellation and actual
availability; scheduler FIFO/cancellation/ambient-context flow; scoped DI and
custom-registration preservation; plus .NET fallback and typed browser
interaction paths.
