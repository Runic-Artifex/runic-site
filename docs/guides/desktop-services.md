# Desktop preferences, notifications, file handoff, and clipboard

`Runic.Platform` defines typed, host-independent contracts. Select an OS provider
explicitly from `Runic.Platform.Windows`, `Runic.Platform.Linux`, or
`Runic.Platform.MacOS`. These provider packages do not discover the operating
system provider or add a generic application-host registration layer.

Factories such as `WindowsPlatformProvider.CreateNotifications(...)` and
`LinuxPlatformProvider.CreateSettings()` return services that the caller owns and
disposes. Native file dialogs, file launchers, and clipboard providers also need
a verified presentation owner. Implement `INativePickerOwner` for the native
window and marshal its `InvokeAsync` callback to that window's UI thread. Keep its
generation and availability tied to the actual presentation; do not retain native
handles beyond the callback or send paths and handles to the browser.

For an embedded Runic Desktop window, `DesktopWindow.DispatchNativeAsync` is the
verified native dispatch primitive from which an owner adapter can be built.
Create and dispose owner-bound services while the native event loop is running.
Provider shutdown drains native callbacks and resource releases; close the native
window only after that cleanup has completed.

The APIs separate picker dismissal (`PickerResult<T>`) from operation success,
unavailability, and failure (`PlatformResult<T>`). File selection returns C#
leases; saves use a staged transaction and report known or uncertain commit
outcomes. `PresentationLifetime` tracks admitted work, and the shared runtime
releases leases and provider resources during disposal.

Linux file dialogs use XDG portals by default with GTK3 parenting. GTK-native
choosers are a separate explicit compatibility choice for unsandboxed apps. GTK4
applications should use the GTK4 portal adapter and must not load GTK3 just to
open a file. Windows notifications require shell registration for the chosen
AppUserModelID. macOS notifications use the application bundle identity.

The [runtime conformance suite](https://github.com/Runic-Artifex/runic-sdk/blob/main/tests/dotnet/Runic.Platform.Runtime.Tests/README.md)
checks portable ownership, cancellation, leases, and file transactions. Its
`--native-services` mode is an interactive OS smoke; portable conformance does
not certify native UI behavior. Provider READMEs record platform dependencies
and native verification status.
